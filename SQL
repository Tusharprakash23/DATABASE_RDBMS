Introduction to Structured Query Lang:-
              Also known as Sequal Query Lang , Sequal stands for structured english lang.
              IBM researchers Roymond Boysee and Donald Chamberlin they introduced SQL in 1970.
              It used to communicate with *Database Server* with the help RDBMS software.
              It is an high level lang(Understand by Human).
              It is not an case sensitive language but data present inside the table is case sensitive.
              SQL each and every query must and should ends with semi-column(;).

DataType:-
           It is used to specify which type of data to be stored in particular column

           Types of database:-
                  1> Number
                  2> Char
                  3> Varchar / Varchar2
                  4> Date
                  5> Decimal

            1> Number:- Syntax: Number(size).
                        It is used to store only number values(0-9).
                        Maxmium size for NUMBER datatype is "38 blocks".
                        It follows variable length memory allocation.

            2> CHAR:- Syntax:- Char(size)
                      It is used to store alphanumeric value along with some special symbols.(0-9 , A-Z, # @ *)
                      it must and should enclosed with single(' ').
                      Max size for CHAR datatype is 2000 blocks.
                      It follow fixed length memory allocation.

            3> Varchar/varchar2 :- Varchar(size).
                                   It is an updated version for CHAR datatype and it is used to store alphanumeric values along with some special symbol.
                                   Max size for varchar is 2000 block and for varchar2 is 4000 blocks.
                                   It follows varible length memory allocation.

            4> Date :- It used to store date values using date formate
                       DATE FORMATE: DD-MM-YYYY  /  DD-MM-YY
